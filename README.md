The only file currently enables emoji substitution that doesn't SUCK for mac applications. 
Open keyboard settings in systems preferences, open Text Replacements and drag and drop the file into the table

This works as of MacOS Sonoma 14.4.1 and should have all the emojis as of when I just made it right now idk

then you will be able to type :weary: and get ðŸ˜© in imessages and notes n stuff. Have fun!
